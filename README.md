# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis

PyBer is Python based ride sharing application. V. Isualize wants an analysis of the ride and city data. Using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type was created. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, the total weekly fares for each city type was visualized in multiple-line graph. Differences between City types was analyzed for key trends in ride sharing usage and payment.

## Results

The total amount of rides and drivers is larger for urban than suburban and rural. The largest total fares is urban, followed by suburban then rural. The average fare per ride iss lower for urban than suburban and rural, and average fare per driver is lower for urban than suburban and rural.

## Summary

According to the data, urban uses ride sharing the most and rural the least. Urban cities have more uses for ride sharing since people live close to each other and travel can be costly. This is evident from the average fare per ride for urban is the lowest. Considering the data, it may make sense to narrow the disparities among city types. Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing these disparities are to decrease drivers in urban cities, to increase price for urban cities, and to increase drivers in suburdan and rural cities. To further this analysis, drive trip data would give insight to how far rides are for each city type.
